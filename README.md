# Daniels-Ideas
This is a test repo and I will be putting stupid things inside to test and grow. 

I am going to add a few lines of code to see how the change log function works. I would hope that it details in either color or some 

Maybe now that I have created my alternative personality I can begin to berate my own work. 

Happy? I removed a phrase that messes with the entire idea of the doc. 


I have created another branch to do the edits in. This will allow us to make any changes and if we totally screw the document up it will not effect how the master looks until I pull it into the master.
