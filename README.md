# Daniels-Ideas
This is a test repo and I will be putting stupid things inside to test and grow. 

I am going to add a few lines of code to see how the change log function works. I would hope that it details in either color or some 

Maybe now that I have created my alternative personality I can begin to berate my own work. 

Happy? I removed a phrase that messes with the entire idea of the doc.
